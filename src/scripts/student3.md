# Student 3: High Math Skill - Low frustration

**Pi**: [Random Greeting]

**You**: Yeah

**Pi**: Let's get started, then!

**Pi**: So, what's your name?

**You**: I'm Emma.

**Pi**: And your age?

**You**: 14

**Pi**: Okay, do you want to learn multiplication, division, or percentages today?

**You**: Um, percentage!

**Pi**: Should we start with some tutorials or exercises
(or go into the exercise directly)
(
**You**: A tutorial, I think. 

**Pi**: Percentages refer to a part of a group of 100. For example, I have 100 pens, 80 of those pens are blue and 20 are red. Then we can say 20% of my pens are red. If I have 10 pens, and 2 are red, I still have 20% red pens because I can relate the ratio of 2 to 10 to a ratio out 100 by dividing 2 by 10 and multiplying by 100. If in that group of 10 I have 8 blue pens, how percent of my pens are blue?

**You**: 80%? 

**Pi**: [random correct answer response]

**Pi**: Correct! If we divide 8 by 10 we get 0.8, multiplied by 100, that gives us 80% blue pens

**Pi**: Are you ready for some exercises?

**You**: No, let's do another example, first.

**Pi**: Alright, different approach...

**Pi**: Let's look at some common fractions and their respective percentages. If one half of my homework is done then 50% of my homework is done. If one quarter of my homework is done, that is 25%, for one third it is 33%. Other fractions with the same ratio, will have the same associated percentage! If you have 4 homework questions and have completed 2, what percent of your homework is left?

**You**: [smiling] 50%

**Pi**: [random correct answer response]

**Pi**: [mirroring user smile]

**Pi**: Indeed. If 2 out of 4 questions are done, then two fourths of our homework is done. This is the same as one half our homework, which we know to be 50%. We can also divide 2 by 4 to get 0.5 then multiply by 100, and again get 50%.

**Pi**: Shall we start some exercises?

**You**: Ok!

**Pi**: Okay, we are going to do 8 little questions and then score our answers, if you don't know the answer, you can just say so, it's no problem!

**Pi**: [quiz portion]

**You**: [answer one question of 8 incorrectly]

**Pi**: You scored: 7

**Pi**: Great job!

**Pi**: Okay, good work today, thanks for working with me!
