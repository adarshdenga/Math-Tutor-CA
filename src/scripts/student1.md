# Student 1: Low Math Skill - High Frustration

**Pi**: [Random Greeting]

**You**: [bored] Hi, yes.

**Pi**: Let's get started, then.

**Pi**: So, what's your name?

**You**: Mary.

**Pi**: And your age?

**You**: 7

**Pi** : [frustration response] You seem stressed, don't worry, this lesson will be fun.
Okay, do you want to learn multiplication, division, or percentages today?

**You**: Multiplication

**Pi**: Should we start with some tutorials or exercises

**You**: Uhm, tutorials, please.

**Pi**: Multiplication is a close friend of addition! We know 2 + 2 is 4, and 2 + 2 + 2 is 6. If we say 2 times 2 is 4,
and 2 times 3 is 6, then you can spot a pattern; multiplication is repeated addition! Let's do an example, what is 1
times 4?

**You**: [frustrated] Is it 5?

**Pi**: Sorry, that's not right! Remember we want 1 times 4 which means we want 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, and we know that is 4!
Actually, any number multiplied by 1 is itself! Meanwhile, any number multiplied by 0 is 0!

**Pi**: [frustration response] Don't get too discouraged though, we are just starting out, it's normal to make mistakes.

**Pi**: Should we try another example?

**You**: Okay

**Pi**: Alright, let's try this.

**Pi**: Multiplication is commutative. That means 10 times 3, where 10 is added 3 times, is the same as 3 times 10,
where 3 is added 10 times. In both cases this is 30. Since we already know what 2 time 3 is, what is 3 times 2?

**You**: [frustrated] I don't know

**Pi**: It's okay!

**Pi**: [frustration response] I know you are trying your best!

**Pi**: Remember we want 3 times 2 which means we want 3 + 3 or 2 + 2 + 2 either way that is 6! It can help to visualise
our problem, you can draw out 2 groups of 3 stars, or 3 groups of 2 stars, and count the total stars to get the correct
answer.

**Pi**: Let's try a different approach!

**Pi**: Alright, different approach...

**Pi**: Think of a real world example. If I have 3 friends and they each want 3 slices of cake, I need a total of 9
slices to feed everyone. Adam, say you have, 5 friends each of them asks for 2 slices of cake. How many pieces of cake
do you need to feed all your friends? (interrupt?)

**You**: [very upset] I actually don't want to study anymore.

**Pi**: Why don't we try working on a different topic for a change?

**Pi**: You know, you are quite good at division, shall we do some exercises in that instead?

**You**: [very upset] No, I don't want to.

**Pi**: [frustration response] I understand you are frustrated.

**Pi**: That's okay! It's good to take a break every once in a while! Come back any time!
