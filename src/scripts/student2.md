# Student 2: Mid-Math Skill - Mid-Frustration 

**Pi**: [Random Greeting]

**Pi**: Let's get started, then.

**Pi**: So, what's your name?

**You**: My name is Amy.

**Pi**: And your age?

**You**: 11

**You**: [smiling] Yep!

**Pi**: [mirroring smile]

**Pi**: Okay, do you want to learn multiplication, division, or percentages today?

**You**: Division 

**Pi**: Should we start with some tutorials or exercises

**You**: A tutorial, I think. 

**Pi**: We can think of division as making equal groups. If we want to divide 10 by 5, how many groups of 5 fit in 10? We know 5 + 5 is 10 , so that means we need 2 groups of 5 to make 10! So 10 divided by 5 is 2. For example, do you know what 4 divided by 1 is?

**You**: [a little upset] I am not sure. 

**Pi**: I understand. 

**Pi**: Remember, we want 4 by 1 which means we want 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 which makes for 4 groups! In fact, any number divided by 1 is itself. Meanwhile we cannot divide by 0 because there is no way to combine 0s to make in this case, a 4.

**Pi**: [frustration response] Don't worry, you will improve with practice!

**Pi**: How about another example?

**Pi**: Alright, different approach...

**Pi**: Let's look at a real world example. I have 4 friends and 8 slices of cake to distribute. If I want everyone to have an equal share, I can divide 8 by 4 and get 2 slices of cake for each friend. If you want to split 10 pieces of cake into equal parts between 2 friends, how many pieces does each friend get?

**You**: It's 5!

**Pi**: [random correct answer encouragement]

**Pi**: That's it! We need 2 groups of 5 to make 10. It helps to remember that when A divided by B is equal to C, B multiplied by C will be equal to A

**Pi**: Are you ready for some exercises?

**You**: Yes, I am 

**Pi**: Okay, we are going to do 8 little questions and then score our answers, if you don't know the answer, you can just say so, it's no problem!

**Pi**: [quiz portion]

**You**: [answer one question of 8 with I don't know, answer 2 questions incorrectly, the rest correctly]

**Pi**: You scored: 5

**You**: [frustrated]

**Pi**: Great job!

**Pi**: [frustration response] I understand you are still frustrated but... 

**PI**: Amy, you're improving! 

**Pi**: Okay, good work today, thanks for working with me!
